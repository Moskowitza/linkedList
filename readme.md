## Linked List

A linked list is collection of nodes where each node holds a reference to it's following, "next", node. A linked list holds reference to the head node.

## Doubly Linked List

Much like the linked list, but each node carries a reference to the previous node.

## Queue

A queue is an _array_ that follows the rule: Items are _added_ to the end and _removed_ from the top of the stack. First in, First Out.

## Stack

A stack is an _array_ that follows the rule: Items are _added_ to the top or _removed_ from the top of the stack. This is how the "call stack" works. Last in, First Out

## Hash Table

## Heap

## Priority Queue

## Trie

## Tree (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
